<a id="introduction" class="anchor" href="#introduction" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Introduction</h2>

<p>The <em>Sequencer</em> is a simple and generic mechanism for timed execution of <em>timed data</em>.</p>

<p>Sequencing is not a new concept. Frameworks for timed media or presentation typically depend on some kind of sequencing. However, implementations are typically internal, custom to specific media formats, and/or tightly integrated with predefined UI solutions. Furthermore, media clocks and media controls (e.g. play/pause) are also internal, making external time coordination and synchronization very hard.</p>

<p>The Sequencer is designed with two main goals.</p>

<h3>
<a id="1-isolate-sequencer-logic-from-data-and-ui" class="anchor" href="#1-isolate-sequencer-logic-from-data-and-ui" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>1) Isolate Sequencer Logic from data and UI.</h3>

<p>The Sequencer is pure JavaScript and fully encapsulates sequencing logic, without references to data formats or UI. By virtue of being <em>data-agnostic</em> and <em>UI-agnostic</em>, the Sequencer makes common timing logic available for any Web application and any purpose.</p>

<h3>
<a id="2-use-the-htmltimingobject-as-timing-source" class="anchor" href="#2-use-the-htmltimingobject-as-timing-source" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>2) Use the HTMLTimingObject as timing source.</h3>

<p>The HTMLTimingObject is a simple concept encapsulating both timing and timing controls. It is proposed as a unifying approach for temporal interoperability in the Web. In short, by sharing a single timing object as timing source, independent components may be precisely coordinated in time. Crucially, this is also true in the distributed scenario, as timing objects support synchronization with online timing objects (Shared Motion). So, by using the timing object as timing source, the Sequencer readily supports precise, multi-device sequencing.</p>

<a id="api-documentation" class="anchor" href="#api-documentation" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>API Documentation</h2>

<p>The Sequencer API is simple. The Sequencer works on a collection of <em>cues</em> and produces event upcalls <em>enter</em> and <em>exit</em> at the correct time. A cue is a <em>(key, Interval)</em> pair. Timing aspects are expressed by <em>Interval</em> objects, supporting both intervals [23.2, 28.7] and singular points [24.7]. The Sequencer API is similar to the <em>HTMLTextTracks</em>, though it improves upon this mechanism in many respects.</p>

<a id="dependencies" class="anchor" href="#dependencies" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Dependencies</h2>

<p>Sequencer and Shared Motion are vanilla JavaScript and should run in every modern browser.</p>

<p>The Sequencer implementation depends of Shared Motion, an early implementation of the HTMLTimingObject provided by the Motion Corporation [<a href="http://motioncorporation.com">http://motioncorporation.com</a>]. The HTMLTimingObject is currently being prepared for standardization by W3C Multi-device Timing Community Group [<a href="https://www.w3.org/community/webtiming/">https://www.w3.org/community/webtiming/</a>], and its design is inspired by Shared Motion. The Sequencer will serve as reference implementation.</p>

<p>For experimentation and development with the Sequencer, please contact the Motion Corporation for access to Shared Motion [<a href="http://dev.motioncorporation.com">http://dev.motioncorporation.com</a>].</p>
