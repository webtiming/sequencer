{"name":"Sequencer","tagline":"A generic JavaScript Sequencer for precisely timed presentation of timed data, using HTMLTimingObject/SharedMotion as timing source. ","body":"## Introduction\r\n\r\nThe *Sequencer* is a simple and generic mechanism for timed execution of *timed data*.\r\n\r\nSequencing is not a new concept. Frameworks for timed media or presentation typically depend on some kind of sequencing. However, implementations are typically internal, custom to specific media formats, and/or tightly integrated with predefined UI solutions. Furthermore, media clocks and media controls (e.g. play/pause) are also internal, making external time coordination and synchronization very hard.\r\n\r\nThe Sequencer is designed with two main goals.\r\n\r\n### 1) Isolate Sequencer Logic from data and UI.\r\nThe Sequencer is pure JavaScript and fully encapsulates sequencing logic, without references to data formats or UI. By virtue of being *data-agnostic* and *UI-agnostic*, the Sequencer makes common timing logic available for any Web application and any purpose.\r\n\r\n### 2) Use the HTMLTimingObject as timing source.\r\nThe HTMLTimingObject is a simple concept encapsulating both timing and timing controls. It is proposed as a unifying approach for temporal interoperability in the Web. In short, by sharing a single timing object as timing source, independent components may be precisely coordinated in time. Crucially, this is also true in the distributed scenario, as timing objects support synchronization with online timing objects (Shared Motion). So, by using the timing object as timing source, the Sequencer readily supports precise, multi-device sequencing.\r\n\r\n## API Documentation\r\nThe Sequencer API is simple. The Sequencer works on a collection of *cues* and produces event upcalls *enter* and *exit* at the correct time. A cue is a *(key, Interval)* pair. Timing aspects are expressed by *Interval* objects, supporting both intervals [23.2, 28.7] and singular points [24.7]. The Sequencer API is similar to the *HTMLTextTracks*, though it improves upon this mechanism in many respects.\r\n\r\nPlease find the full documentation [http://webtiming.github.io/sequencer/api.html]\r\n\r\n## GitHub Project\r\n[https://github.com/webtiming/sequencer]\r\n\r\n## Dependencies\r\nSequencer and Shared Motion are vanilla JavaScript and should run in every modern browser.\r\n\r\nThe Sequencer implementation depends of Shared Motion, an early implementation of the HTMLTimingObject provided by the Motion Corporation [http://motioncorporation.com]. The HTMLTimingObject is currently being prepared for standardization by W3C Multi-device Timing Community Group [https://www.w3.org/community/webtiming/], and its design is inspired by Shared Motion. The Sequencer will serve as reference implementation.\r\n\r\nFor experimentation and development with the Sequencer, please contact the Motion Corporation for access to Shared Motion [http://dev.motioncorporation.com].\r\n\r\n## Authors\r\n- Ingar Mæhlum Arntzen (ingar.arntzen@norut.no) (@ingararntzen)\r\n\r\n## Acknowledgements\r\nThe development of the Sequencer is funded by the EU FP7 MediaScape project [http://mediascapeproject.eu] and results are contributed to the W3C Multi-device Timing Community Group.\r\n\r\n- Njål Borch (njaal.borch@norut.no) (@snarkdoof) has been much involved in testing, evaluation and API design.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nCopyright 2015 Norut Northern Research Institute.\r\nAuthor : Ingar Mæhlum Arntzen\r\n\r\nThe Sequencer is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\nThe Sequencer is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
