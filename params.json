{"name":"Sequencer","tagline":"A generic JavaScript Sequencer for precisely timed presentation of timed data, using HTMLTimingObject/SharedMotion as timing source. ","body":"## Sequencer in a nutshell\r\n\r\n> The *Sequencer* is a simple and generic mechanism for timed execution of *timed data*.\r\n\r\nSequencing is not a new concept. Frameworks for timed media or timed presentation are always built around some form of sequencing logic. However, implementations are typically internal, custom to specific media formats, and tightly integrated with predefined UI solutions. Furthermore, media clocks and media controls (e.g. play/pause) are also implemented internally, making external time coordination and synchronization difficult.\r\n\r\nTo address these issues, the Sequencer is designed with two main goals.\r\n\r\n**1) Isolate Sequencer logic from data and UI.**\r\nThe Sequencer is pure JavaScript and fully encapsulates sequencing logic, without introducing any dependencies to data formats or UI. By virtue of being *data-agnostic* and *UI-agnostic*, the Sequencer makes common timing logic available for any Web application and any purpose.\r\n\r\n**2) Use the HTMLTimingObject as timing source.**\r\nThe HTMLTimingObject is a simple concept encapsulating both timing and timing controls. It is proposed as a unifying approach for temporal interoperability in the Web. In short, by sharing a single timing object as timing source, independent components may be precisely coordinated in time. Crucially, this is also true in the distributed scenario, as timing objects support synchronization with online timing objects (Shared Motion). So, by using the timing object as timing source, the Sequencer readily supports precise sequencing in both single-device and multi-device scenarios.\r\n\r\n## Navigation\r\n\r\n[HOME](http://webtiming.github.io/sequencer/) [API](http://webtiming.github.io/sequencer/api.html) [CODE](https://github.com/webtiming/sequencer)\r\n\r\n## Dependencies\r\nSequencer and Shared Motion are vanilla JavaScript and should run in every modern browser.\r\n\r\nThe Sequencer implementation depends of Shared Motion, an early implementation of the HTMLTimingObject provided by the Motion Corporation http://motioncorporation.com. The HTMLTimingObject is currently being prepared for standardization by W3C Multi-device Timing Community Group https://www.w3.org/community/webtiming/, and its design is inspired by Shared Motion. The Sequencer will serve as reference implementation.\r\n\r\nFor experimentation and development with the Sequencer, please contact the Motion Corporation for access to Shared Motion http://dev.motioncorporation.com.\r\n\r\n## Authors\r\n- Ingar Mæhlum Arntzen (ingar.arntzen@norut.no) (@ingararntzen)\r\n\r\n## Acknowledgements\r\nThe development of the Sequencer is funded in part by the EU FP7 MediaScape project http://mediascapeproject.eu, and results are contributed as reference implementation to the W3C Multi-device Timing Community Group.\r\n\r\n- Njål Borch (njaal.borch@norut.no) (@snarkdoof) has been much involved in testing, evaluation and API design.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nCopyright 2015 Norut Northern Research Institute.\r\n\r\nAuthor : Ingar Mæhlum Arntzen\r\nThe Sequencer is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\nThe Sequencer is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
